## Technical Implementation

### CSS Custom Properties
The admin panel uses CSS custom properties for consistent theming:
```css
:root {
    --primary: #6366f1;
    --secondary: #8b5cf6;
    --accent: #06b6d4;
    --primary-fg: #ffffff;
    --header-color: #1e293b;
    --link-fg: #6366f1;
    --link-hover-color: #4f46e5;
    --button-hover-bg: #4f46e5;
    --button-fg: #ffffff;
    --button-bg: #6366f1;
}
```

### Template Inheritance
All custom templates extend Django's default admin templates:
- `base_site.html` extends `admin/base.html`
- `index.html` extends `admin/index.html`
- Custom model templates extend their respective admin templates

### Admin Actions
Custom admin actions are implemented using Django's `@admin.action` decorator:
```python
@admin.action(description="Mark selected tasks as completed")
def mark_tasks_completed(modeladmin, request, queryset):
    queryset.update(completed=True)
    modeladmin.message_user(request, f"{queryset.count()} tasks marked as completed.")
```
